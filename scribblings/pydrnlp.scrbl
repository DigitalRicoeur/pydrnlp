The @racketmodname[pydrnlp] repository contains:
@itemlist[
 #:style 'ordered
 @item{A Python 3 library providing some NLP functionality 
  needed by Digital Ricoeur.
 }
 @item{A Racket package that serves as a wrapper
  for the Python library.
  }]

@margin-note{The functionality described in this document
is still at an experimental stage.
}

The initial goal is to support the NLP functionality needed
to implement our own versions of the widgets that
Digital Ricoeur currently gets from Voyant.


@;{
 The Python code is in `py/pydrnlp/`.
 A Conda environment is expected at `py/condaenv/` based on
 the specification at `py/requirements.yaml`.
 In the future, it would be good to have Racket set
 this up automatically.
 I am trying Conda for now because it provides `spaCy`
 pre-built, but I haven't ruled out using venv.
    
 The directory `py/compare-env-vars/` contains Racket
 scripts and data that were used interactively
 to see what environment variables are set by activating
 a Conda or venv virtual environment.
    
 The `old/` directory contains various things
}
